BAMG
====

BAMG! is a chrome-extension that allows you to control your browser by only using your voice. So far, it is only usable on Facebook, but we will make it available on other social networks soon. Add this extension to your Chrome browser, by accessing chrome://extensions from your navigation bar. Let the fun begin, as you are randomly insulted with Game of Thrones paraphrased quotes. However, do not let thyself be fooled by this, as you are the boss. Simply state "down" or "up" and the application will scroll for you. Say "like" and you will instantly like the status/the photo of anyone. Other features that we have implemented include sending messages, viewing groups and profiles and so on. In order to implement this app we have used the Web Speech API from Google, Chrome platform and javascript.
